**ðŸ“£ Understanding Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**

**Objective**: The primary objective of this project is to explore and understand customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. By employing machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, the aim is to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior.

**Methodology:** 

*Data Preprocessing:

*Handle missing values.

*Normalize or scale features.

*Feature Selection:


**K-means Clustering**: Utilizing a dataset containing age, customerID, annual income and spending score, we applied the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into groups exhibiting similar purchase patterns. Specifically, features such as annual income and spending score were considered to create meaningful clusters. The spending score(0-100) is given to every customer based on the money spent and frequency of purchase of the customer.

**Insights Gained:** The analysis revealed 5 distinct customer segments or clusters characterized by varying spending scores and income. For instance, one cluster has high income but low spending score, while another consisted of low income and low spending score. Understanding these segments could assist in tailored marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and optimizing business operations to cater to each segment's needs effectively.

**Conclusion:** Through K-Means clustering, this project successfully uncovered valuable insights into customer segmentation, laying the groundwork for targeted marketing campaigns and enhancing customer satisfaction. The project underscores the significance of leveraging machine learning techniques to derive actionable insights from customer data for business growth and optimization.
